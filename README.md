1: Reverse shell written in python for circuitPython picoducky
Requires: 

- ...python v? (on both client and server machine)

- raspberry pi pico with the picoducky project installed (https://github.com/dbisu/pico-ducky)

  Steps:
  
  a) Customize client (rev_shell/client_revshell.py) to add your ip or other features
  
  b)  Run reverse_shell script to generate output/payload.dd (base64 encodes script)
  
  c)  Move payload.dd to your picoducky and... i guess hope it works?

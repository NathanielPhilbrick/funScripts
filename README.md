1: Reverse shell written in python for circuitPython picoducky
Requires: ...python v? (on both client and server machine)

  Steps:
    - Customize client (rev_shell/client_revshell.py) to add your ip or other features
    - Run reverse_shell script to generate output/payload.dd (base64 encodes script)
    - Move payload.dd to your picoducky and... i guess hope it works?
